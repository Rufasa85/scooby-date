    <h1>Welcome to scooby date!</h1>
    <p>Here at the world’s first dating site made exclusively for Scooby doo fanatics, we put people like you first. Our team of world class engineers has put together an algorithm that will almost undoubtedly find you your Scooby-dooby-soulmate.™</p>
    <h3>So how does it work?</h3>
    <p>Upon signing up, our setup wizard will guide you through a series of questions for our AI to get to know you a little better. Next, we use state of the art technology to make 1000s of perfect virtual replicas of your brain, and subject each of them to a variety of simulated relationships with other users on our site (like the Hang the DJ Black Mirror episode). Once the simulated versions of you have reached a consensus on your perfect match (via only a pinch of trauma), we bring your and your soulmate together in real life for a romantic evening of a Scooby Doo marathon date night. And the y’all take it from there ;)
